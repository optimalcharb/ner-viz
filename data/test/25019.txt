Matching Algorithm
The Gradual Time-Based Pro Rata (“GTBPR”) matching algorithm combines a priority component with a time and
volume weighted (pro rata) allocation and is used for allocating incoming order volume to resting bids and offers at
each price level in the central limit order book. The best price in the market must always be fully traded before the next
best price is considered. The priority order is subject to a minimum order volume (collar) and a maximum priority
volume (cap), where an order will receive priority if it is above the collar and will be filled in full up to the cap before any
other order is filled.
Once the priority order has been filled, all resting orders (including the priority order) will participate in pro rata
allocation using the GTBPR matching algorithm. The GTBPR algorithm includes a Time Weight component and
performs a pro rata allocation based on resting order volume, modified by the Time Weight. A greater Time Weight
increases the allocation of volume to older orders in the order book. If the Time Weight is 1 then the allocation will
essentially be a pure pro rata allocation.

Interval Price Limits
The Interval Price Limit (IPL) provides functionality to limit large price movements from occurring within a given time
frame. For each contract there will be a set limit, the IPL, to which prices can move within a set time frame known as
the re-calculation time. If a bid or offer attempts to breach the IPL, the market will enter a hold period preventing any
further trading beyond the limit until the end of the hold period. Trading can still continue during the hold period within
the upper and lower parameters of the IPL. At the end of the hold period new parameters are set based on the
prevailing market prices.
